    //So in JS this is how to write down a function.
    //functional hoisting
    //means you can call a function before declaring


    //So, how to call a function


    //you can use return statement also


    //Two types of function
    //01. Declaration
    //if a function is with a method signature it's a declaration

    //02. Expressions
    //if a function is assigned to a variable it's a expression

    //arrow functions

    //The reason why js has first class functions


    //what about overloading.?
    function myName(id,name){
        console.log("First Method")
    }

    function myName(id,name,address){
        console.log("Second Method")
    }


    myName("C001","Dasun");
    //not supporting overloading
    //always will execute the last method if there are more than one method
    //with the same name
